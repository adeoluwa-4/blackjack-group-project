# Blackjack (Points Edition) — Documentation-First Starter

This starter focuses on **specs and stubs**, not full code. The goal: give your team a clear plan,
file layout, and method responsibilities so new teammates can implement features confidently.

- `.NET 8` console app skeleton
- All public methods are **stubs** with XML docs and TODOs
- `docs/` has your **architecture**, **task breakdown**, and **Git/GitHub workflow**

## How to use this
1. Open in your editor (Gothic, VS Code, etc.).
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` then `docs/TASKS.md`.
3. Each teammate picks a task. Implement the TODOs in the corresponding stub files.
4. Commit early and often. Open small PRs.

## Build/Run (after implementation begins)
```bash
cd src/BlackjackGame
dotnet run
```
